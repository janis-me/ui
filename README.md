# `@janis.me/ui` - react components, like it's 2025

The idea:
Basically just radix-ui, but styled with `@janis.me/themed` and a well-defined theming approach, allowing for ultimate theming with the lowest amount of effort.

As you can see, it's not yet done. :) In the meantime, enjoy a picture of my cat, and maybe checkout my other projects on my [github](https://github.com/janis-me)
